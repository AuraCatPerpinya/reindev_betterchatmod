# reindev_betterchatmod

## What is this?
This is a simple mod for [ReIndev 2.8.1_04](https://reindev.miraheze.org/wiki/Reindev_Wiki), and for ReIndev's own mod loader called [FoxLoader](https://github.com/Fox2Code/FoxLoader), that aims to improve on the chat feature of base ReIndev. (Which is based of Minecraft Beta 1.7.3)

## Okay cool, but... what does it do?
It currently:
- Extends the chat history up to 1024 messages (instead of 50 in base ReIndev).
- Adds a "past sent messages history" (You can suggest a better wording).

  Basically the feature that you have in modern Minecraft, with the up and down keys to navigate through your past sent messages & commands (max 1024 messages/commands).

  **Note that currently this "past sent messages history" is global, it is across worlds/servers.**

- New in 1.1.0: You can use the "home" and the "end" keys to move the cursor at the extremities of the chat text field

(I might make some things customizable in the future).

## How to install?
Make sure you have [FoxLoader](https://github.com/Fox2Code/FoxLoader) installed.

Preferably version 1.2.17+, for [ReIndev 2.8.1_04](https://reindev.miraheze.org/wiki/Reindev_Wiki).

And then, just put the mod into your "mods" folder, and voil√†, enjoy. :)
