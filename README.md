# reindev_betterchatmod

## What is this?
This is a mod for [ReIndev 2.8.1_04](https://reindev.miraheze.org/wiki/Reindev_Wiki), and for ReIndev's own mod loader called [FoxLoader](https://github.com/Fox2Code/FoxLoader).

## What does it do?
It currently:
- Extends the chat history up to 1024 messages (instead of 50 in the base ReIndev).
- Adds a "chat input history" (You can suggest a better wording).

  Basically the feature that you have in modern Minecraft, with the up and down keys to navigate through your past sent messages (max 1024 messages).

  Note that currently this "chat input history" is global, it is across worlds/servers.

(I might make these things customizable in the future).
