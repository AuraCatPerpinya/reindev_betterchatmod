# reindev_betterchatmod

## What is this?
This is a mod for [ReIndev 2.8.1_04](https://reindev.miraheze.org/wiki/Reindev_Wiki), and for ReIndev's own mod loader called [FoxLoader](https://github.com/Fox2Code/FoxLoader).

## What does it do?
It currently:
- Extends the chat history up to 1024 messages (instead of 50 in base ReIndev).
- Adds a "past sent messages history" (You can suggest a better wording).

  Basically the feature that you have in modern Minecraft, with the up and down keys to navigate through your past sent messages & commands (max 1024 messages/commands).

  **Note that currently this "chat input history" is global, it is across worlds/servers.**

(I might make these things customizable in the future).
